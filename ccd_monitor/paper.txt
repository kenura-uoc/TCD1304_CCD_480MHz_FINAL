The diffusion coefﬁcients of acetone, methyl acetate, and chloroform in
amorphous poly(vinyl acetate) are estimated using the solvent evaporation
method. The evaporation process from polymer solutions, cast in the form of
thin ﬁlms, is studied as a numerical experiment. The process is modeled as a
coupled heat and mass transfer problem with a moving boundary. Lattice
ﬂuid (LF) thermodynamics is used to describe polymer-solvent system volu-
metric properties and to derive appropriate expressions for solvents’ chemical
potentials. The resulting nonlinear system of governing equations is solved
with the Galerkin ﬁnite element method. The estimated diffusion coefﬁcients
are in satisfactory agreement with reported data.

INTRODUCTION
The binary diffusion coefﬁcient in solvent-polymer systems is of major
importance for a number of industrial processes, including membrane,
foam, and coating formation, devolatilization, mixing of additives and
plasticizers, and effectiveness of polymerization reactors at high conver-
sion. In addition, the diffusion of small molecules in a polymer matrix is
essential for miscellaneous polymer products such as controlled drug
delivery systems, barrier materials, and membranes for separation
(Zielinski and Duda, 1996).
The industrial importance of diffusion coefﬁcients in polymer sys-
tems has led to extensive work in their measurement and estimation.
Measurement techniques include sorption and desorption, radiotracer
methods, chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
experiments as reviewed by Crank and Park (1968), Tyrrell and Harris
(1984), and Cussler (1984). Predictive models based on the free volume
concepts may be used for the estimation of polymer-solvent diffusion
coefﬁcients, as developed by Ju et al. (1981a), Zielinski and Duda (1992),
and Vrentas et al. (1996).
The experimental complexities in the measurement of diffusion
coefﬁcients and the need for increased accuracy in their estimation was
the starting point for the development of the solvent evaporation method.
This method combines simple laboratory experiments with advanced
modeling in order to get accurate estimates of the diffusion coefﬁcients.
In particular, the laboratory experiments consist of gravimetric mea-
surement of the solvent evaporation rate from appropriate cast polymer-
solvent ﬁlms. The measured solvent evaporation rate is compared with
model predictions in order to estimate the unknown parameters of dif-
fusion coefﬁcient correlation based on free volume theory.
This idea was proposed by Ataka and Sasaki (1982). However, the
implementation of powerful numerical methods such as Galerkin ﬁnite
elements allowed its realization by studying the solvent evaporation process
in the general framework of computational transport phenomena. Price
et al. (1997) were the ﬁrst who got estimates of the diffusion coefﬁcients
by ﬁtting drying rate in order to optimize the performance of industrial
dryers. Recently, Verros and Malamataris (1999) estimated the binary
and the self-diffusion coefﬁcient of an acetone-cellulose acetate system by
using established gravimetric measurements of the acetone evaporation
rate. The evaporation process was studied as a one-dimensional numer-
ical experiment utilizing the Galerkin ﬁnite element method. The numeri-
cal technique provides simultaneous solution of the model equations and

yields, by comparison with gravimetric data, the diffusion coefﬁcients of
acetone in cellulose acetate over a wide range of temperature and com-
position. The estimated diffusion coefﬁcients based on free volume theory
were in satisfactory agreement with experimental data of Park (1961),
Anderson and Ullman (1973), Reuvers and Smolders (1987), and Sano-
poulou et al. (1995).
In the present work, the solvent evaporation method is applied to
estimate the diffusion coefﬁcients of three liquid solvents, namely, acet-
one, methyl acetate, and chloroform in poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAC).
Despite their importance, little is known about these diffusion coefﬁ-
cients. Kokes et al. (1952) and Ju et al. (1981b) performed sorption
experiments to measure binary diffusion coefﬁcients of acetone in PVAC
and chloroform in PVAC, respectively. Arnould and Laurence (1992)
utilized capillary column inverse gas chromatography to measure the
gaseous acetone and methyl acetate diffusion coefﬁcient in PVAC at the
limit of pure polymer. However, diffusion of these solvents over a wide
range of temperature and concentration has not been studied yet, due to
the complexity of experimental methods and modeling techniques. Lat-
tice ﬂuid thermodynamics is used for the ﬁrst time in this area as it is
simple and accurate in describing polymer-solvent interactions as shown
by Sanchez and Lacombe (1976a, 1976b), and Panayiotou and Sanchez
(1991).
In the next section, a brief description of the experimental part is
given and the experimental procedures for preparing solvent-polymer
thin ﬁlms and measuring evaporation rate are described. In the modeling
section, the governing equations of the solvent evaporation process are
given along with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Lattice
ﬂuid thermodynamics is introduced in the section on model parameters to
describe polymer-solvent interactions. Finally, the ﬁnite element for-
mulation is given, results are presented, and conclusions are drawn.
EXPERIM ENT AL P ART
The aim of this work is to determine the diffusion coefﬁcients of various
solvents in amorphous PVAC by comparing the measured evaporation
rate with model predictions. The evaporation rate from PVAC solutions
cast in the form of thin ﬁlms was measured gravimetrically, and for this
purpose an experimental procedure has been designed, as shown in
Figure 1.
The PVAC used was purchased from BDH Chemicals Ltd. (weight-
average molecular weight 51,000). The prepared solutions were cast
in thicknesses in the range of 180 /C0 240 mm on clean glass slides
(1 /C6 0.01 mm /C2 70 mm /C2 50 mm) with the aid of a ‘‘doctor’s knife.’’ To
measure the solvent evaporation rate gravimetrically, the cast liquid ﬁlms

(after their preparation) were transferred to a microbalance (accuracy
10/C0 4 gr), which was connected to a personal computer for data acquisi-
tion (three measurements per second). To prevent heat exchange between
the glass slides and the microbalance pan, the glass slides were placed on
an insulating block resting upon the microbalance pan (Figure 1). The
microbalance was exposed to the ambient air, so that accumulation of
solvent vapor in the vicinity of the equipment was avoided and zero
solvent concentration in the bulk of gas phase was ensured.
It was found convenient to express the measured evaporation rate in
terms of instantaneous solvent/polymer mass ratio because, in this way,
the experimental results are presented uniformly. To determine polymer
mass, the ﬁlms were dried for several hours in an oven at 80
/C14C after the
evaporation rate measurement, until a constant weight was obtained.
MODELING OF SOLVENT EVAPORATION PROCESS
Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions
The system consists of a liquid layer resting upon an impermeable solid
support exposed to a gas phase of temperature T0, as shown in Figure 1.
The liquid layer is the PVAC solution and has an initial thickness L0.The

support is a ﬂat, horizontal glass plate with constant thickness Lsup,
allowing heat exchange with the polymer solution. Prior to time zero, the
polymer solution has a constant initial solvent concentration everywhere
in its mass and the whole system is at initial temperature T0. At time t ¼ 0,
a liquid-gas interface is suddenly created by exposing the polymer solu-
tion to the gas phase. The solvent begins to evaporate, resulting in a
downward motion of the liquid-gas interface. As the solvent at the sur-
face evaporates, the gas-liquid interface is cooled. From an engineering
point of view, this is a coupled heat and mass transfer process with a
moving boundary.
Assuming one-dimensional Fickian diffusion, which is valid as it was
shown by numerous workers in the area (Shojaie et al., 1992; Vrentas and
Vrentas, 1994; Cairncross et al., 1995; Guerrier et al., 1998; Alsoy and

Equation (8) is the energy balance at the moving interface, equating the
heat conduction to the polymer solution with free convection heat
transfer, radiant heat transfer from the ambient air, and latent heat loss
due to solvent evaporation. Equation (9) implies continuity of tempera-
ture and heat ﬂux at the glass plate-polymer solution interface, while
Equation (10) implies perfect insulation of the glass support lower surface.
Conservation of polymer mass gives the following equation for the
instantaneous liquid layer thickness, L(t), deﬁning the position of the
moving boundary (Vrentas and Vrentas, 1994; Verros and Malamataris,
2001b):

where r2 represents PVAC mass concentration and V 1 and V 2 are the
partial speciﬁc volumes of the solvent and PVAC, respectively.
To facilitate numerical solution of the problem, the above equations
are rendered dimensionless. After dedimensionalizing mass concentration
r, temperature T, and thickness of the solution L with initial solvent
concentration o10, and initial temperature of the process T 0 and initial
thickness of the solution L 0, the dimensionless equations deﬁning the
evaporation model become:

The z parameter for the PVAC-acetone system was equal to unity, as
shown by Luengo et al. (1994). Similarly, for the PVAC-methyl acetate
system, z was found equal to 1.012 by comparing the Flory-Huggins
chemical potential with the lattice ﬂuid chemical potential Equations
(28)/C0 (30). Finally, the z parameter for the PVAC-chloroform system was
found equal to 1.023 by ﬁtting the activity coefﬁcients as determined by
sorption equilibrium experiments (Ju et al., 1981b). Introducing the effect
of hydrogen bonding between chloroform and PVAC and applying lat-
tice ﬂuid with hydrogen bonding thermodynamics yields a z value closer
to unity. A detailed presentation of the lattice ﬂuid with hydrogen
bonding theory is given by Panayiotou and Sanchez (1991).
The main advantage of lattice ﬂuid thermodynamics over the Flory-
Huggins theory is the introduction of an accurate equation of state
describing variation of polymer density with constituents’ concentration
and temperature, including mixing phenomena (Sanchez and Lacombe,
1976a, 1976b). Additionally, this theory describes chemical potential
variation with temperature and concentration more accurately than the
Flory-Huggins theory. From a modeling point of view, lattice ﬂuid theory
is more attractive even in the case when there is a lack of experimental
data for the density dependence on concentration and temperature.
The speciﬁc heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the
polymer solution were calculated from pure substance data by the fol-
lowing simple mixing rule:
P ¼ P

where P is property of the solution, o1 is weight fraction of the solvent,
and P1 and P2 denote corresponding property of the solvent and PVAC,
respectively.
The thermophysical properties of pure liquid solvents, PVAC, and
glass support are given in standard references.

where r1 and m1 are mass concentration and chemical potential of the

chemical potential with respect to the solvent mass concentration is
directly calculated.
In the present work, we utilize the Vrentas and Duda (1977a, 1977b)
equation for self-diffusion coefﬁcient that includes concentration and
temperature dependence of diffusion coefﬁcient. According to the free

Data for thermophysical properties of solvent vapor and air are available
in standard references (Dean, 1973; VDI, 1974; Perry and Green, 1984).
As shown by Verros and Malamataris (1999; 2001b), these correlations
for heat and mass transfer accurately reproduce experimental results for
temperature at the gas-liquid interface.

The computational domain is discretized in 15 ﬁnite elements. Residuals
are evaluated numerically using three-point Gaussian integration, and
time integration follows the Euler backward method. The resulting sys-
tem of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved with Newton-Raphson
iteration according to scheme q
ðnþ1Þ ¼ q /C0 J/C0 1RðqðnÞÞ, where q is the
vector of unknowns and J is the Jacobian matrix of residuals R with
respect to the nodal unknowns q. The maximum time step was equal to
10/C0 2. The computer program exhibits quadratic convergence in three to
ﬁve iterations at each time step. Any additional mesh reﬁnement or time
step decrease has an improvement of less than 10
/C0 6 in the accuracy of the
solution.
A detailed presentation of the ﬁnite element technique that enables
simultaneous solution of the primary unknowns of the problem (solvent
weight fraction and temperature) with the moving boundary can be
found in Kistler and Scriven (1983) and Finlayson (1992).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to estimate the diffusion coefﬁcients, gravimetric data of solvent
evaporation rate was compared with model predictions utilizing
nonlinear regression analysis. The objective function requires the sum of
squares of differences between the predicted and measured solvent eva-
poration rate to be minimal. The primary unknown in the parameter
estimation procedure was x (see Equation (33)). If the resulting ﬁtting
between model predictions and experimental data was not satisfactory,
quantities D
0 and E were added to the estimation procedure.
The resulting ﬁtting for acetone evaporation is shown in Figures 2
and 3. The estimated value of x was 0.59 /C6 0.02. This result is in complete
agreement with the reported value (0.6) of Arnould and Laurence (1992)
who measured diffusion coefﬁcient of gaseous acetone in PVAC at the
limit of pure polymer. Both experiment and model predictions show that
as the initial polymer solution thickness increases, the rate of evaporation
decreases since the solvent is provided at the surface with lower rate.
Variation of temperature with time at the gas liquid interface is shown in
Figure 4. Overall temperature variation is from 10 to 20
/C14C, which is the
range of validity of estimated diffusion coefﬁcients.

The temperature minimum of the thinner solution (180 mm) is
reached faster than for the thicker one (240 mm) as expected due to a
higher evaporation rate. The minimum value of temperature of the
thicker solution is smaller because the amount of evaporated solvent is
larger. This behavior has also been observed in the binary system acet-
one-CA (Verros and Malamataris 1999, 2001a).
Figure 5 depicts the proﬁles of acetone weight fraction as a function
of dimensionless thickness. Variation of acetone weight fraction was from
0.6 to almost zero, which is the rate of validity of estimated diffusion
coefﬁcients. In the beginning of the evaporation process, a smooth
decrease in the acetone proﬁle is observed. As evaporation proceeds,
steep gradients are exhibited, and the value of acetone weight fraction at
the interface is close to zero. This behavior is attributed to the fact that
diffusion in the polymer ﬁlm is very slow due to increased polymer
concentration, while evaporation at the surface is high, leading, thus, to
steep gradients near the gas-liquid interface. Establishment of these steep
gradients (at approximately 64 s) leads to further deceleration of the
evaporation rate, because both diffusion and solvent evaporation at the
interface become minimal due to increased polymer concentration
throughout the solution. This causes small variation of acetone weight
fraction at longer times, since in the ﬁrst 64 s, 65% of evaporated acetone

is removed while the rest of the evaporated acetone is removed up to the
end of the experiment at 220 s. This behavior is quite different from what
is observed in the case of nonsolvent/solvent/polymer ternary solutions
(Verros and Malamataris, 2001b), where steep gradients near the inter-
face appeared from early evaporation times while solvent concentration
at the bulk is almost unaffected.
Figures 6 and 7 show temperature proﬁles as a function of the
solution thickness, prior to (0 /C20 t /C20 64) and after minimum temperature
attainment. Although the evaporation process is nonisothermal, the
temperature in the polymer solution is uniform except for the beginning
of the experiment where a small gradient is observed from the bottom up
to the surface. This behavior is attributed to small variations of thermal
conductivity and speciﬁc heat capacity with polymer concentration.
Additionally, the heat transfer rates of the process are much higher than
these of mass transfer as thermal diffusivity is of the order of 10
/C0 7m2=s,
compared to diffusion coefﬁcient, which is of the order of
10
/C0 9/C0 10/C0 17m2=s (Figure 8).
However, in Figure 6, temperature proﬁles have a slight negative
slope as expected by the decrease in surface temperature due to acetone

evaporation, while in Figure 7 slopes become positive because of the
increase at surface temperature (see Figure 4).
In Figure 8, a comparison is made between estimated diffusion
coefﬁcients and measurements by Kokes et al. (1952). The estimated
binary diffusion coefﬁcient is almost one order of magnitude above the
measured ones by acetone vapor sorption, and this difference is increased
as acetone concentration increases. Similar differences between diffusion
coefﬁcients measured by sorption and estimated by solvent evaporation
for the system cellulose acetate-water were reported by Verros and
Malamataris (2001b). This discrepancy is attributed to inherent differ-
ences between sorption experiments and the liquid evaporation method.
In Figures 9 and 10, an excellent agreement is depicted between
model predictions for methyl acetate evaporation rate and experimental
data for estimated values of x in the range 0.59 /C6 0.05. The corresponding
value for x reported by Arnould and Laurence (1992) is 0.65. During the
experiments the temperature varied from 20
/C14Ct o1 0 /C14C as shown in
Figure 11. Comparing Figure 11 and Figure 4 we observe that the
minimum temperature for the methyl acetate-PVAC system is the same in
both experiments, while the minimum temperature for the acetone-PVAC
system is attained at the same time for both experiments.

The excellent agreement between model prediction and experimental
data for the chloroform evaporation rate is illustrated in Figure 12. The
estimated values for D 0, E, and x were 2.82 m 2=s, 42800 J/gmol, and 0.69,
respectively. Corresponding values for D 0,E ,a n d x, reported by Ju et al.
(1981b; 1992b) are 6.12 10 7 4 m2/s, 30222 J/gmol, and 0.64, respectively.
They applied Vrentas-Duda free volume theory to correlate binary diffu-
sion coefﬁcients obtained from sorption experiments. In Figure 13, pre-
dicted binary diffusion coefﬁcients are compared with experimental data of
Ju et al. (1981b). The observed discrepancy is attributed to the different
range of temperature and to inherent differences between the solvent eva-
poration method and sorption experiments. In Figure 14, it is shown how
temperature at the gas-liquid interface varies during evaporation. Upper
and lower limits, for temperature are 20
/C14C and 15 /C14C, respectively.
Figure 15 depicts the chloroform proﬁles along the solution as func-
tion of time. Compared to the case of acetone (Figure 5), more solvent
(chloroform) is trapped in the solution. This phenomenon is attributed to
lower values of diffusion coefﬁcients (Figure 13), which is caused by high
critical energy (E) of diffusion and difference in chemical afﬁnity.
Finally, errors introduced by uncertainty of values of heat and mass
transfer coefﬁcients are negligible since the evaporation process is con-
trolled by diffusion in the liquid phase. More speciﬁcally, it was shown

(Verros and Malamataris, 1999) that variation of heat and mass transfer
coefﬁcients by /C6 100% does not affect evaporation rate.
CONCLUSIONS
For the ﬁrst time, in this work we estimated diffusion coefﬁcients of
three solvents, namely, acetone, methyl acetate, and chloroform in
amorphous PVAC, using the solvent evaporation method. The experi-
mentally determined evaporation rate from polymer-solvent thin ﬁlms
was compared with model predictions in order to estimate diffusion
coefﬁcients based on free volume theory. For this purpose, the coupled
heat and mass transfer of the evaporation process is modeled as a one-
dimensional numerical experiment with a moving boundary. Lattice
ﬂuid thermodynamics was used to describe variations of polymer
solution density and solvent chemical potential with concentration and
temperature. The resulting complex system of governing equations
along with appropriate initial and boundary conditions is solved with
Galerkin ﬁnite elements. The estimated unknown parameters of diffu-
sion coefﬁcient correlations, based on free-volume theory, are in satis-
factory agreement with available experimental data from the literature.

Discrepancies between the estimated diffusion coefﬁcients and experi-
mental data are due to the complexity in obtaining accurate measure-
ments and to uncertainty of model parameters. Comparing the diffusion
behavior of three solvents, we observed that acetone and methyl acetate
are trapped in PVAC in smaller amounts than chloroform. This is
attributed to the high critical energy of chloroform diffusion. In all
cases, the nonisothermal character of the diffusion process has been
conﬁrmed, although the temperature at each time step was almost
uniform in the solution. Steep gradients in the solvent concentration
were observed from the beginning of the evaporation and gradually
become steeper at the end of the process. It is believed that the present
work establishes the solvent evaporation technique as a general tool
that may be applied to other polymer-solvent systems for the estimation
of diffusion coefﬁcients over a wide range of concentration and tem-
perature, providing a valuable insight into the physics of diffusion and a
more rational design of polymeric products.
